# Thesis-Work
These are the codes that I used to analyze the data collected for my thesis project. This includes the code to analyze microcolony and colony data. The data itself is not shared in this page.


Cruz_micro_analysis:
This file includes the code used to test the interactive effects of heat wave and high humidity on all of the response variables measured in microcolonies, including: pollen consumption, abdominal lipid contents, thoracic lipid contents, drone produciton, drone weights, drone development time, and microcolony growth rate.


Cruz_colony_analysis:
This file includes the code used to test the interactive effects of heat wave and high humidity on all of the response variables measured in colonies, including: queen survival, colony growth rate, colony foraging, colony worker production, gyne cell production, and drone production.
